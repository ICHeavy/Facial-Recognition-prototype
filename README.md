# Facial-Recognition-prototype
A quick prototype that detects a human face and dispense a liquid via a stepper motor. Used to demo a project that promotes public medication dispensers

Used an H7 max board and uPython to spin a stepper motor rigged to a crude water pump. Utilized a keypad input (wired to accept only 1 button as an input to save on input ports used). 

Built in about an hour.
